# SoliFood

SoliFood is a web application developed by a team from ENSET Mohammedia and GDSC (Google Developer Students Club) to address the global challenges of food wastage and hunger. It is designed to connect sellers with surplus food to buyers seeking affordable, nutritious alternatives.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Angular and Progressive Web App (PWA) technologies, SoliFood offers a smooth and intuitive user experience across various devices and platforms. Whether accessing the application from a desktop browser or a mobile device, users can expect consistent performance and functionality.
- **Security and Scalability**: Firebase's robust suite of tools ensures that SoliFood remains secure and scalable as it grows. From user authentication and authorization to real-time database management, Firebase provides the necessary infrastructure to support SoliFood's evolving needs while safeguarding user data..
- **Environmental Impact**: By reducing food waste, SoliFood contributes to environmental sustainability while addressing hunger.
- **Advanced Search**: SoliFood's standout feature is its advanced search functionality, powered by Google Cloud's speech-to-text API and enhanced by semantic search with Gemini embeddings.
